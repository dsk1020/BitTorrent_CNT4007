## Team Collaboration
All team members collaborated effectively to establish the initial peer-to-peer socket and client connections.

### Nick
- Implemented the chocking/unchoking mechanism.
- Handled parsing and exportation of downloaded files.

### David
- Developed functionality for parsing, sending, reading, and interpreting various types of messages.

### Renee
- Utilized configuration file information to construct each Peer Process.
- Implemented handling for Bitfield messages.

## What we were able to accomplish
Our project successfully implemented the establishment of a Peer-to-Peer network to share a file using TCP. This process involves the sending of handshake choke, unchoke, interested, not interested, have, bitfield, request, and piece messages.

### Handshake Message
The handshake consists of three parts: handshake header, zero bits, and peer ID. The header is used to identify that a message is a handshake message, and the peer ID is used to match the peers up with each other.

An example of Peer 1002 successfully establishing a connection with Peer 1001 using a handshake message in **log_peer_1002.log**: <br>
`01:41:28: Peer 1002 makes a connection to Peer 1002.` <br>
`01:41:28: Peer 1002 is connected from Peer 1001.`

### Actual messaging
Actual messages include the message length, type, and payload. The type is used to interpret the message so each peer knows how to respond.

### Choke and unchoke
Peers share file information with preferred neighbors and an opmtimistically unchoked neighbor. Each peer uploads its pieces to at most k preferred neighbors and 1 optimistically unchoked neighbor. The value of k is given as a parameter in the Common.cfg file. Each peer uploads its pieces only to preferred neighbors and an optimistically unchoked neighbor. We say these neighbors are unchoked and all other neighbors are choked. The interval in which peers select new neighbors and a new optimistically unchoked neighbor is determined by the Common.cfg file

An example of Peer 1003 being choked and unchoked by different neighbors in **log_peer_1003.log**: <br>
`01:41:43: Peer 1003 is unchoked by 1002` <br>
`01:41:45: Peer 1003 is choked by 1001`

An example of the preferred neighbors and optimistically unchoked neighbor of Peer 1007 at a given point in time in **log_peer_1007.log**: <br>
`01:42:30: Peer 1007 has the preferred neighbors 1008,1006,1001.` <br>
`01:42:30: Peer 1007 has the optimistically unchoked neighbor 1001.`

### Interested and Not Interested
Peers send interested messages to other peers for pieces of the file that it needs. If a neighbor does not have any interesting pieces,
then the peer sends a ‘not interested’ message to the neighbor.

An example of interested and not interested messages being received by Peer 1004 in **log_peer_1004.log**:
`01:42:10: Peer 1004 received the 'interested' message from 1005` <br>
`01:42:10: Peer 1004 received the 'not interested' message from 1001` <br>

### Have and Bitfield
Peers send have messages to all connected neighbors when they receive a piece. Bitfield messages are only sent as the first message right after handshaking is done when a connection is established. Each bit in the bitfield payload represents whether the peer has the corresponding piece or not. 

An example of have message logging in **log_peer_1004.log**: <br>
`01:41:51: Peer 1004 received the 'have' message from 1003 for the piece 55.`

### Request and Piece
When a connection is unchoked by a neighbor, a peer sends a ‘request’ message for requesting a piece that it does not have and has not requested from other neighbors. On receiving peer A’s ‘request’ message, peer B sends a ‘piece’ message that contains the actual piece. After completely downloading the piece, peer A sends another ‘request’ message to peer B. 

An example of piece message logging in **log_peer_1003.log**: <br>
`01:43:21: Peer 1003 has downloaded the piece 128 from 1002. Now the number of pieces it has is 103.`

### Exporting the downloaded file
When a peer finishes downloading all file pieces, it exports the file into it's own directory with the name 'downloaded' + fileName. (tree.jpg is exported as downloadtree.jpg, for example.) A peer terminates when it finds out that allthe peers, not just itself, have downloaded the complete file.

An example of Peer 1003 finishing the download of the file in **log_peer_1003.log**: <br>
`01:44:15: Peer 1003 has downloaded the piece 15 from 1008. Now the number of pieces it has is 133.` <br>
`01:44:18: Peer 1003 has downloaded the complete file.` <br>

## What we didn't accomplish
Despite our implementation being functional, there were a few smaller nuances to a normal P2P program that we omitted due to technical difficulties.

### Download Rate
In a typical P2P program, a peer would factor in the fastest download rates of its neighbors when determining what neighbors to choke and unchoke. Due to difficulties with timing functions, our program does not consider these rates in the choking processes.
